# Image 2 Lines

**The implementation of this tool is from the following paper** "A Statistical approach to line segmentation in handwritten documents" Manivannan Arivazhagan, Harish Srinivasan and Sargur Srihari. 

  It can be found at [this link](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.88.5806&rep=rep1&type=pdf).

This tool converts handwritten text image (including straight and skewed lines) to text. Afterwards, It'll afterwards integrated with a machine learning tool to detect characters.

The main aim of this project is to compile and execute (try to repair compilation errors too! :) ) code handwritten on paper

## Tools used:
We'll use C++ and OpenCV.
